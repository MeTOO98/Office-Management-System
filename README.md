# Office Management System – OOP Project

This project simulates an office environment using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It includes managing employees, their vehicles, work routines, salaries, and office operations like hiring, firing, and checking lateness.

## Project Description

The project uses four main classes:

 1.Person – Represents a general person with attributes like name, mood, health rate, and money.

 2.Employee – Inherits from Person and adds attributes like ID, email, salary, and a Car object.

 3.Car – Simulates a car with fuel and velocity management.

 4.Office – Manages employee operations like hiring, firing, salary management, and attendance checking.

The goal is to model real-life office interactions using OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
